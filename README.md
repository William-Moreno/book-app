- Book app

**Author**: Nick Abramowicz, William Moreno, Wondwosen Tsige

**Version**: 0.0.1

## Overview

We are implementing a basic full-stack application for a book list. Our book list will have a functionality to search the Googlebook API, add books to our database, and be able to render those books from a pSQL database. The user has the ability to update the details of the book or remove it from the collection.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user must create a repository and include neccessary config files, create a basic server and install all necessary npm packages.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
